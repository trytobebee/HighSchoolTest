# HighSchoolTest
record the code of my son's info class exercises

just updated the package by adding more basic lib function and examples
- strmatch, kmp algorithm
- sorter, contains bubble sort and select sort, also included the template version
- mathfunc, basic math functions, like prime check, check how many same elements in two sorted arrays

started on 2023-12-11, it's also my first jouney in github although I have been working on code developing for years and already famous for the super successful lightGBM project.
